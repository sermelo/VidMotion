=== Description  ===
Ony tested in Linux
Alternative way to move the mouse using a webcam, and an object to track
This is a software under devlopment. So don't expect to replace your mouse 
with the program at the moment

=== Build Dependencies ===
OpenCV
X11

=== Compile ===
make

=== Use ===
Algorithms:
   PatternMatch: Very Quick, Can confuse with the background, can handle rotations
   Surf: It is slower, don't work fine with moving images, it can handle rotations

The executable: VidMotion
Optional Parameters:  
    -c x: x is the number of camera device. By default it is 0
    -f: Apply customized HSV filter
    -R: Select a region in which the pattern will be searched
    -S: Use surf algorithm

Step 1:
    Choose from the screen a region where the object to track is located.
    For example: A hand

Step 2:
    Only if you use -f parameter and not -S. Configure an HSV filter. Not always useful. To end this phase press enter.

Step 3:
    Only if you use -R parameter. To select region place the object at one corner(up-left for example) and place enter.
    Then place the object in the oposit corner(down-left) and press enter.

Step 4: 
    Move the hand and you will see the mouse moving
    It's Important to keep the object in the same position and at the same distance
    If -R parameter have been used, move the object only in the region.
